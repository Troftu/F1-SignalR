# F1-SignalR
A simple test program that subscribes to the undocumented F1 live timting data API via SignalR.

Today I came across this awesome python project https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1 that provides access to various F1 statistics. It inspired me to try making a connection and subscribing to live data from the (un)official F1 API in time for todays race. It worked, but at the moment it is all it does - Connect via (old) SignalR, set up the data subscriptions and log all the information to the console.
